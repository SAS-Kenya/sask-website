				The Skeptics and Atheist Society of Kenya is a community for all
				who lack belief in the existance of a god or gods.
				<br />
				<br />
				A place where rationality, skepticism and human rights are the
				order of the day, where freedom of
				<br />
				expression is appreciated not demonized and open and respectful
				sharing of information and opinions
				<br />
				is encouraged.
				<br />
				<br />
				We are of the opinion that it is important to question what it
				is you believe and why. Without questioning,
				<br />
				there is no way to know whether the beliefs you hold are true or
				false.
				<br />
				<br />
				We host debates and discussion every Friday and Sunday. We also
				have a youtube channel.
				<br />
				<br />
				Membership is open to anyone. We hope you find this community
				welcoming and inspiring.
